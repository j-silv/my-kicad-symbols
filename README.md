# Some of my personal KiCad symbols

This repo contains some KiCad symbols I've created for use in general-purpose schematic drawings. The symbols include alternate MOSFET and voltage/current source representations.

I've built these symbols with KiCad v7.0.

Here are some schematic examples using these symbols:

## How to use

To use these symbols in KiCad, follow [these instructions](https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html#tutorial_part_4_custom_symbols_and_footprints).
